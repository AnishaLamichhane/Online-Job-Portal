            <p class="mt-3">A job portal, also known as a career portal, is a modern name for an online 
            job board that helps applicants find jobs and aids employers in their quest to locate ideal 
            candidates. Career websites, such as Monster, Indeed and SimplyHired, have job portals that 
            offer a broad range of jobs in a vast number of fields. Some government agencies, nonprofit 
            organizations, universities and private businesses have their own job portals that applicants
            can access on the organization's website.
